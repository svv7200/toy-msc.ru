# toy-msc.ru
Development of a website for the sale of handmade stuffed toys.

This repository contains the code for my awesome website, which consists of three pages:

- [Home Page](#https://github.com/svv7200/toy-msc.ru/blob/main/index.html)
- [Catalog Page](#catalog.html)
- [Contact Page](#send.html)

## Home Page

On the home page, you will find a level one heading, a title, and a catalog of some products. Here, I showcase my products and provide users with an overview of the available items on my website.

## Catalog Page

The catalog page showcases all the products available on the website, divided into specific categories. It provides users with a comprehensive view of the different product categories, making it easy for them to explore and find what they are looking for.

## Contact Page

The contact page contains information for getting in touch with me. If you have any questions, inquiries, or need assistance with purchases or technical support, you can find the relevant contact details here. Don't hesitate to reach outâ€”I'm here to help!
